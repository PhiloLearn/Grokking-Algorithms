# preface

I first got into programming as a hobby Visual Basic 6 for Dummies taught me the basics, and I kept reading books to learn more. But the subject of algorithms was impenetrable for me. I remember savoring the table of contents of my first algorithms book, thinking "I'm finally going to understand these topics!" But it was dense stuff, and I gave up after a few weeks. It wasn't until I had my first good algorithms professor that I realized how simple and elegant these ideas were.

A few years ago, I wrote my first illustrated blog post. I'm a visual learner, and I really liked the illustrated style. Since then, I've written a few illustrated posts on functional programming, Git, machine learning, and concurrency. By the way I was a mediocre writer when I started out. Explaining technical concepts is hard. Coming up with good examples takes time, and explaining a difficult concept takes time So it's easiest to gloss over the hard stuff I thought I was doing a pretty good job, until after one of my posts got popular, a coworker came up to me and said, "I read your post and I still don't understand this." I still had a lot to learn about writing

Somewhere in the middle of writing these blog posts, Manning reached out to me and asked if I wanted to write an illustrated book. Well, it turns out that Manning editors know a lot about explaining technical concepts, and they taught me how to teach. I wrote this book to scratch a particular itch: I wanted to write a book that explained hard technical topics well, and I wanted an easy-to-read algorithms book. My writing has come a long way since that first blog post, and I hope you find this book an easy and informative read.

# acknowledgments

Kudos to Manning for giving me the chance to write this book and letting me have a lot of creative freedom with it. Thanks to publisher Marian Bace, Mike Stephens for getting me on board, Bert Bates for teaching me how to write, and Jennifer Stout for being an incredibly responsive and helpful editor. Thanks also to the people on Manning's production team: Kevin Sullivan, Mary Piergies, Tiffany Taylor, Leslie Haimes, and all the others behind the scenes. In addition, I want to thank the many people who read the manuscript and offered suggestions: Karen Bensdon, Rob Green, Michael Hamrah, Ozren Harlovic, Colin Hastie, Christopher Haupt, Chuck Henderson, Pawel Kozlowski, Amit Lamba, Jean-Fran√ßois Morin, Robert Morrison, Sankar Ramanathan, Sander Rossel, Doug Sparling, and Damien White

Thanks to the people who helped me reach this point: the folks on the Flaskhit game board, for teaching me how to code, the many friends who helped by reviewing chapters, giving advice, and letting me try out different explanations, including Ben Vinegar, Karl Puzon, Alex Manning, Esther Chan, Anish Bhatt, Michael Glass, Nikrad Mahdi, Charles Lee, Jared Friedman, Hema Manickavasagam, Hari Raja, Murali Gudipati, Srinivas Varadan, and others; and Gerry Brady, for teaching me algorithms. Another big thank you to algorithms academics like CLRS, Knuth, and Strang. I'm truly standing on the shoulders of giants.

Dad, Mom, Priyanka, and the rest of the family: thank you for your constant support. And a big thank you to my wife Maggie There are many adventures ahead of us, and some of them don't involve staying inside on a Friday night rewriting paragraphs.

Finally, a big thank you to all the readers who took a chance on this book, and the readers who gave me feedback in the book's forum. You really helped make this book better

about this book

This book is designed to be easy to follow I avoid big leaps of thought. Any time a new concept is introduced, I explain it right away or tell you when I'll explain it Core concepts are reinforced with exercises and multiple explanations so that you can check your assumptions and make sure you're following along

I lead with examples. Instead of writing symbol soup, my goal is to make it easy for you to visualize these concepts. I also think we learn best by being able to recall something we already know, and examples make recall easier. So when you're trying to remember the difference between arrays and linked lists (explained in chapter 2), you can just think about getting seated for a movie. Also, at the risk of stating the obvious. I'm a visual learner This book is chock-full of images

The contents of the book are carefully curated. There's no need to write a book that covers every sorting algorithm-that's why we have Wikipedia and Khan Academy All the algorithms I've included are practical. I've found them useful in my job as a software engineer and they provide a good foundation for more complex topics Happy reading!

## Roadmap

The first three chapters of this book lay the foundations

- Chapter 1-You'll learn your first practical algorithm binary search You also learn to analyze the speed of an algorithm using Big O notation. Big O notation is used throughout the book to analyze how slow or fast an algorithm is.

- Chapter 2-You'll learn abe es fundamental data strictures:
arrays and linked lists. These data structures are used through the book, and they're used to make more advanced data structures like hash tables (chapter 5)

- Chapter 3-You'll learn about recursion & handy techniques by many algorithms (such as quicksort, covered in chapter 4)

In my experience Big O notation and recursion are challenging topics for beginners So I've slowed down and spent extra time on these

sections The rest of the book presents algorithms with broad applications

- Problem-solving techniques-Covered in chapters 4. 8, and 9. If you come across a problem and aren't sure how to solve it efficiently, try divide and conquer (chapter 4) or dynamic programming (chapter 9) Or you may realize there's no efficient solution, and get an approximate answer using a greedy algorithm instead (chapter 8)

- Hash tables-Covered in chapter 5 A hash table is a very useful data structure It contains sets of key and value pairs, like a person's name and their email address, or a username and the associated password It's hard to overstate hash tables usefulness When I want to solve a problem, the two plans of attack I start with are "Can I use a hash table?" and "Can I model this as a graph?"

- Graph algorithms Covered in chapters 6 and 7 Graphs are a way to model a network a social network, or a network of roads, or neurons, or any other set of connections. Breadth first search (chapter 6) and Dijkstra's algorithm (chapter 7) are ways to find the shortest distance between two points in a network you can use this approach to calculate the degrees of separation between two people or the shortest route to a destination.

- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-Covered in chapter 10. This is a simple machine learning algorithm. You can use KNN to build a recommendations systern, an OCR engine, a system to predict stock values-anything that involves predicting a value ("We think Adit will rate this movie 4 stars) or classifying an object ("That letter is a Q

- Next steps-Chapter 11 goes over 10 algorithms that would make good further reading.

## How to use this book

The order and contents of this book have been carefully designed. If you're interested in a topic, feel free to jump ahead. Otherwise, read the chapters in order-they build on each other.

I strongly recommend executing the code for the examples yourself. I can't stress this part enough. Just type out my code samples verbatim (or download them from https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms or https://github.com/egonschiele/grokking_algorithms), and execute them. You'll retain a lot more if you do,

I also recommend doing the exercises in this book. The exercises are short-usually just a minute or two, sometimes 5 to 10 minutes. They will help you check your thinking, so you'll know when you're off track before you've gone too far.

## Who should read this book

This book is aimed at anyone who knows the basics of coding and wants to understand algorithms. Maybe you already have a coding problem and are trying to find an algorithmic solution. Or maybe you want to understand what algorithms are useful for. Here's a short, incomplete list of people who will probably find this book useful:

- Hobbyist coders

- Coding boot camp students

- Computer science grads looking for a refresher

- Physics/math/other grads who are interested in programming

## Code conventions and downloads

All the code examples in this book use Python 2.7. All code in the book is presented in a `fixed-width font like this` to separate it from ordinary text Code annotations accompany some of the listings. highlighting important concepts.

You can download the code for the examples in the book from the publisher's website at www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms or from https://github.com/egonschiele/grokking_algorithms

I believe you learn best when you really enjoy learning-so have fun, and run the code samples!
